amoeba
======

My old proof of concept of a worm that hunts for other ones, that replicates through mass storage media. 
It also do some tricks to make it a bit harder to get infected in the future.
Made in C++ in C style, using WinAPI.

I got sick when I always got infected in my high school labs...

I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY OF RUNNING THIS CODE.

I belive it's old enough to get published :)
